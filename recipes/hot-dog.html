        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Hot dog is a junk food dish consisting of a bun and a sausage. Condiments and garnishes vary in different parts of the world.
            Condiments that are used most often in hot dog preparation include ketchup, mustard and relish. 
            Typical garnishes are diced onions, sauerkraut, chili, grated cheese, etc.

        <p>
            It is not known who started serving sausages in a bun.
            There are several possible origins dated back to the end of the 19th beginning of 20th century.
            The term dog has been used as a synonym for sausage since the 1800s, possibly because of the accusations that sausage makers used dog meat.
