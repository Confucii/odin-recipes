        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Churro is a type of fried dough from Spanish and Portuguese cuisine, 
            made with choux pastry dough piped into hot oil with a piping bag and large closed star tip or similar shape.
            They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in champurrado, hot chocolate,
            dulce de leche or café con leche. Cinnamon sugar is often sprinkled on top.
        </p>
        <p>
            The origin of churros is unclear. One theory suggests the concept was brought to Europe from 
            China by the Portuguese. The Portuguese sailed for the Orient and as they returned from Ming-dynasty 
            China to Portugal, they brought along with them new culinary techniques, including altering dough for youtiao, 
            also known as yóuzháguǐ in southern China which bears a resemblance to the churro.

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
